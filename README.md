## 🧠 What I’m About

I don't just wanna be another dev who builds things.

I'm obsessed with how things work. I go deep. I lose hours going off-track, digging into internals instead of just using stuff on the surface.  
My bookmarks? They’re an endless jungle of articles, docs, RFCs — all tagged "read later", and somehow they just keep going forever.  
I couldn't catch up reading all of those yet.

Honestly, I like staying hectic😂. Always got a side project running so I never hit boredom mode.  
No big hobbies. Maybe scrolling X when I need a reset (not sure if that counts, but hey, that’s what I do).

I prefer learning by building. I don’t feel like I actually *know* something unless I build with it.

## 🛠️ On The Road

- Crack clean open source contributions  
- Push side projects that actually do something useful  
- Learn AI + Web3 fundamentals like a mad scientist  
- Build a strong personal brand with code, not buzzwords

## My Philosophy

* Not chasing job titles.(Of course I need a job, but I’m not learning just to get one.)
---

## My Talent

I can make my code work easier than my stupid-ass mind😭
